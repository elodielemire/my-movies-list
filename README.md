This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Personnal project to manage the movies I've watched and the one I want to watch.

## Functionalities :

- 2 tabs : Movies to watch and movies watched.
- Button to add a movie to watch.
- When it's watched, click on it and add some details (rate /5, with who, when, where).
- The movie goes in the 'watched' list with its details, which can be shown by clicking on the movie.
- Sort movies by number of stars (rate).
